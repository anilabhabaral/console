<p>The Jakarta EE Connector Architecture (JCA) defines a standard architecture for Jakarta EE systems to external heterogeneous Enterprise Information Systems (EIS). Examples of EISs include Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, mainframe transaction processing (TP), databases, and messaging systems. A resource adapter is a component that implements the Jakarta EE Connector API architecture.</p>
<p>JCA 1.7 provides features for managing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>connections</li>
    <li>transactions</li>
    <li>security</li>
    <li>life-cycle</li>
    <li>work instances</li>
    <li>transaction inflow</li>
    <li>message inflow</li>
</ul>
<p>JCA 1.7 was developed under the Java Community Process as

<h2>Resource Adapters</h2>
<p>A resource adapter is a deployable Jakarta EE component that provides communication between a Jakarta EE application and an Enterprise Information System (EIS) using the Java Connector Architecture (JCA) specification. A resource adapter is often provided by EIS vendors to allow easy integration of their products with Jakarta EE applications.</p>
<p>An Enterprise Information System can be any other software system within an organization. Examples include Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, database systems, e-mail servers and proprietary messaging systems.</p>
<p>A resource adapter is packaged in a Resource Adapter Archive (RAR) file which can be deployed to ${build.shortName}. A RAR file may also be included in an Enterprise Archive (EAR) deployment.</p>
