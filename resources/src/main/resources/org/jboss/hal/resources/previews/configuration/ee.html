<p>The EE subsystem provides common functionality in the Jakarta EE platform, such as the EE Concurrency Utilities (JSR 236) and <code>@Resource</code> injection. The subsystem is also responsible for managing the lifecycle of Jakarta EE application's deployments, that is, .ear files.</p>
<p>The EE subsystem configuration may be used to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allows the customisation of the deployment behaviour for Jakarta EE applications.</li>
    <li>Manage global modules: a set of JBoss Modules that will be added as dependencies to the JBoss Module of every Jakarta EE deployment. Such dependencies allows Jakarta EE deployments to see the classes exported by the global modules.</li>
    <li>Manage EE concurrency utilities (JSR 236): It was introduced to ease the task of writing multithreaded Jakarta EE applications. Instances of these utilities are managed by ${build.fullName}, and the related configuration provided by the EE subsystem.</li>
</ul>
